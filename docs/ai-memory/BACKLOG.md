# Prioritised backlog

Reviewed 2026-10-07. These are investigations/opportunities, not ten proven defects.
Before implementation check latest Git, ledgers and PRs again. P0 broken/dangerous;
P1 high impact; P2 growth; P3 experiments. Do not change live routing or infrastructure
without the required evidence and approval.

| Rank | Priority | Opportunity | Evidence / next verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | P1 | Repair Services navigation destination | /services/ lands at homepage; inspect unfollowed HTTP responses and Plesk/IIS rules, validate a small fix in isolation | Confirmed navigation behaviour; cause open |
| 2 | P1 | Reconcile deployment copies and protection | Current root deploy differs from README mirror guidance; compare changed pages, fingerprint checks and live result | Open |
| 3 | P1 | Reconcile sitemap inventory | Latest report has 362 entries vs expected ~115; identify aliases, noindex/canonical targets and generator inputs before removal | Open; no blind URL deletion |
| 4 | P1 | Validate audit classification | AUDIT-REPORT marks all 107 pages weak; scripts rely on seo-article marker and local paths | Open; reproduce false positives first |
| 5 | P1 | Check enquiry flow on mobile | Telephone CTAs present; actual consultation/booking path and conversion data not yet checked | Open; no real customer enquiry submission |
| 6 | P1 | Resolve legacy fridge/freezer query landing paths | gsc_followup still shows homepage/legacy aliases; obtain current query/page rows, then inspect routing before targeted changes | Open |
| 7 | P1 | Check trusted business claims | Live homepage includes reviews, certifications and experience/job-count claims; authoritative evidence not reviewed | Needs owner/source records; do not invent or call them false |
| 8 | P1 | Reconcile live schema with intended entity | Homepage is HVACBusiness + FAQPage despite older ApplianceRepair claim; compare canonical entity IDs and copies | Open; no blind global replacement |
| 9 | P2 | Verify money-page mobile performance | Historical Lighthouse results were local lab with SSI limits; establish current live CWV/lab baseline | Open |
| 10 | P2 | Verify recent SEO Draft mitigation | Root ledger documents repeated failures and bounded-call fix on 6 October; check next genuine run result before more changes | Open; scheduler not accessed |

Existing work tracked separately: PR #14 named crawler exclusions is already implemented
on its branch and awaiting review. Do not duplicate it as a fresh opportunity.
Completed earlier work (metadata templates, broad noindex cleanup, homepage service
links, Liebherr page, backup/rank tooling) is not automatically a new task.

First completed foundation: six memory files on a dedicated branch. Highest-confidence
next website task is #1 investigation; implementation depends on proving the responsible
routing rule and testing for loops.

## 2026-10-07 update
Opportunity #1 is resolved: the Services home redirect was in .htaccess. Ten live route
checks passed after the focused production change. Keep the regression checker for
future deploys. Remaining separate work: make the Services hub more useful, then
validate indexation in Search Console; neither is claimed complete by this routing fix.

## 2026-10-07 — Crawl policy continuation and current status
Services routing task is completed: PR #15 merged/deployed, ten live routes pass. Continue existing crawl-policy PR #14: proven named-group exclusion bug, 192 checks pass; release verification pending. Sitemap inventory reconciliation remains the next priority; inspect canonical/noindex/redirect entries before removing URLs.

## 2026-10-07 — Sitemap inventory correction
PR #14 was explicitly approved, merged as 9453f995 and successfully deployed; 112 live robot policy checks and ten route checks passed. This supersedes earlier pending approval notes.

Fresh live sitemap: 362 entries, all unique: 226 redirects, 132 HTTP 500, two HTTP 404, two HTTP 200; those two declare other canonicals. The existing generator walked mirrors/internal repository paths and advertised raw .html/index.html aliases. Replaced it with public canonical discovery, robots/noindex filtering, live redirect/canonical resolution, deduplication and fail-before-write on transport/429/5xx. Both sitemap copies are identical. Daily workflow now stages the root sitemap it actually generates. Unverified lastmod dates omitted rather than marking every page freshly changed each run.

Prepared sitemap: 112 unique URLs, all freshly checked HTTP 200 with no noindex. Four focused regression tests pass. This is discovery-list cleanup, no page deletion or route/content change. No search ranking/indexation gain claimed; production release is pending. Some served pages declare a bare canonical that redirects to their slash URL; normalized served URLs are listed, while metadata consistency remains a separate task.

Next P0 routing investigations: /blog/commercial-fridge-repair-cost-london/ and its .html alias redirect to each other; /refrigeration-brands-repair-london/ returns 404. Both are excluded from this sitemap, not deleted. Recheck current policy before fixing routes. Also retain the current public ASP canonicals for chiller/ice-machine pages pending a separate canonical review.

## PR16 release complete — 2026-10-07
User explicitly approved PR16 merge and Plesk release. Merge 500634e3dda456d27b04e1d178f9785ff90dddc8; deployment run 37652640835 completed successfully. Live map matches approved 112 URLs; all return HTTP 200 without noindex. Ten core route/Services content and 112 robots policy checks pass. Earlier pending/rejected release notes are superseded. No Google ranking/indexation uplift measured. Next daily scheduled run is unverified. Post-release memory is committed on ai/seo-canonical-sitemap to avoid an additional documentation-only production deployment.

## 2026-10-07 — Daily Search Console monitoring active
Existing GSC service account reused with webmasters.readonly. No new access/key or unsupported Indexing API call. Codex automation colddirect-google-indexing-check is ACTIVE, daily at 09:00 Europe/London, in the existing chat. It executes the local C:\Users\khora\Documents\Codex\2026-10-07\c\gsc-monitor.py and compares completed snapshots in reports/gsc-monitor. Reports meaningful index/sitemap/API changes in Farsi; stays quiet on unchanged state. Google already accepted sitemap submission and Services indexing request; do not repeatedly submit it.
First full manual monitor run passed on 2026-10-07: 112 sitemap URLs, PASS=57, NEUTRAL=55. This is a first baseline, not newly gained rankings/indexation. First scheduled run is unverified. Local machine/app and required permissions/network must be available for future runs.
Alert checks pass for unchanged state, newly indexed page, loss of indexing and first baseline. An initial sequential run was stopped after 25 inspected URLs due to latency; no partial baseline was saved. Final implementation uses four independent HTTP clients with 30-second timeouts, bounded retries and writes only after all inspections succeed. Routine last-crawl timestamp changes do not trigger alerts. No production edits/deployment performed. Preserve existing Hermes/GitHub scheduled jobs; inventory found no existing Codex automation directory.
Next P0 website work remains the blog repair-cost redirect loop and brands canonical 404; monitoring is not their repair. Existing bulk Indexing API scripts are not invoked and still require separate correction/inventory before use.

## 2026-10-07 — Coordinated technical audit and first team repair
User authorized teamwork and automatic continuation. Head agent coordinated read-only workflow inventory, implementation and independent routing review. Existing GitHub writers: sitemap/robots02:00UTC, dailySEO05:00UTC, protected-page restore05:45UTC, root deploy on main/master push. Hermes evening schedules are documented, not fresh scheduler proof. Do not add a competing production writer.
Daily existing heartbeat colddirect-google-indexing-check updated ACTIVE at09:00London, name ColdDirect website SEO and engineering. It runs local website-health.py and gsc-monitor.py independently, reports meaningful changes/errors in Farsi, and can research/prepare isolated tested P0/P1 PRs with independent specialist review. It does not publish/merge unattended and must respect access/approval boundaries. First scheduled run remains unverified.
Public technical audit:112sitemap URLs,120unique requested paths;14issue records:three aliases of one cost redirect loop, brands404, nine bare/slash canonical inconsistencies, news missingH1. Eight fixturetests pass. Known Services/index.html canonical alias explicitly handled. Initial Accept header omitted the server XMLtype and was fixed to */*; no incomplete snapshot saved. Earlier falseServices canonical issue was audit correction, not website improvement. Snapshot currently at workspace reports/website-health/latest.json. PHP/operational routes excluded; reviewed publicASP canonicals only. Fourworkers30sec/2MB/samehost/8redirecthop bounds; transport/prerequisite failures preserve prior complete baseline.
