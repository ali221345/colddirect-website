## 2026-10-07 — Initial current-state review and memory
Base: af339f118bfbd069c1deda91e4b589e3e241ac5b (main).
Branch: ai/docs-project-memory.

Read README, recent commits and branches, repository tree, deployment workflow,
LESSONS-LEARNED.md, seo_fixes.md, audit scripts/report, latest daily search report,
gsc_followup.md and previous competitive/change/upgrade documents.
Checked open PRs; found existing crawl-policy draft PR #14.

Signed into the user-provided Plesk and observed Active domain plus existing httpdocs.
Opened LESSONS-LEARNED.md; its visible opening matches the repository ledger.
Closed the editor using Cancel. No file save, hosting change or data mutation.

Viewed the live www homepage; checked canonical, description, H1, parseable JSON-LD
types and footer links. Direct /services/ navigation ended at /. Live robots access
was blocked by browser client. No HTTP-chain measurement or booking submitted.

Added these six memory files without replacing any historical ledgers.
Validation: checked six required paths, reviewed sources and diff scope; documentation
only, no production-code changes. Docs are excluded by current FTP deploy workflow.
No production deployment, SEO uplift or full technical audit claimed.

Commit: docs: establish ColdDirect operational project memory.
Use this commit message/branch to locate the commit in Git history; its SHA is assigned
after these files are committed. No self-referential SHA fabricated.

## 2026-10-07 — Authorized Services routing fix
Read root history, memory and deployed files. Reproduced 301 to / by GET and HEAD.
Proved exact .htaccess rule in /httpdocs; saved pre-change backup locally. Edited only
the services redirect and added an index.html exception. Applied via Plesk editor.
Verified ten live routes using tools/check-services-routing.py, Services H1/canonical/
indexing/schema, plus existing homepage and four service routes. JSON-LD validator
scanned 418 files with zero errors. Fresh browser query displays Services (old 301 cached).
Updated both repository .htaccess copies, six memory files and root lessons. Merge
uses [skip ci] to preserve unrelated live work while recording the already applied fix.
No SEO uplift claimed; no enquiry/payment submitted; no IIS/DNS/security settings changed.

## Merge status — 2026-10-07
PR #15 is ready for review but NOT merged. Automatic approval review rejected the
merge because main triggers automatic Plesk deployment and could overwrite unrelated
production files. Do not bypass or retry without approval/evidence resolving that risk.
The focused /httpdocs/.htaccess fix remains live and tested; source changes are on
ai/docs-project-memory. Main still contains the old rule until approved integration,
so a future deployment from main could reintroduce it. No deployment settings changed.

## 2026-10-07 — Crawl policy continuation and current status
Read all six memory files and root lessons; inspected existing PR #14 diff and main 15886fb. Fresh HTTP robots matched old policy. Re-ran PR #14 checker in an isolated validation directory: 192 checks passed. Continued the original branch, preserved current main including Services fix, and appended current memory. No content rewrite or ranking uplift claimed. PR #14 release verification pending.

## PR #14 release gate — 2026-10-07
Automatic approval review rejected the production merge: main triggers automatic Plesk deployment, risking overwrite of unrelated live files; exact PR14 production approval is required. No merge/deployment performed and no workaround attempted. Prepared policy passes 192 checks. Explicit approval requested; pending user response.

## 2026-10-07 — Sitemap inventory correction
PR #14 was explicitly approved, merged as 9453f995 and successfully deployed; 112 live robot policy checks and ten route checks passed. This supersedes earlier pending approval notes.

Fresh live sitemap: 362 entries, all unique: 226 redirects, 132 HTTP 500, two HTTP 404, two HTTP 200; those two declare other canonicals. The existing generator walked mirrors/internal repository paths and advertised raw .html/index.html aliases. Replaced it with public canonical discovery, robots/noindex filtering, live redirect/canonical resolution, deduplication and fail-before-write on transport/429/5xx. Both sitemap copies are identical. Daily workflow now stages the root sitemap it actually generates. Unverified lastmod dates omitted rather than marking every page freshly changed each run.

Prepared sitemap: 112 unique URLs, all freshly checked HTTP 200 with no noindex. Four focused regression tests pass. This is discovery-list cleanup, no page deletion or route/content change. No search ranking/indexation gain claimed; production release is pending. Some served pages declare a bare canonical that redirects to their slash URL; normalized served URLs are listed, while metadata consistency remains a separate task.

Next P0 routing investigations: /blog/commercial-fridge-repair-cost-london/ and its .html alias redirect to each other; /refrigeration-brands-repair-london/ returns 404. Both are excluded from this sitemap, not deleted. Recheck current policy before fixing routes. Also retain the current public ASP canonicals for chiller/ice-machine pages pending a separate canonical review.

## PR16 release complete — 2026-10-07
User explicitly approved PR16 merge and Plesk release. Merge 500634e3dda456d27b04e1d178f9785ff90dddc8; deployment run 37652640835 completed successfully. Live map matches approved 112 URLs; all return HTTP 200 without noindex. Ten core route/Services content and 112 robots policy checks pass. Earlier pending/rejected release notes are superseded. No Google ranking/indexation uplift measured. Next daily scheduled run is unverified. Post-release memory is committed on ai/seo-canonical-sitemap to avoid an additional documentation-only production deployment.

## 2026-10-07 — Search Console connected and discovery submitted
User signed into Search Console; URL-prefix property https://www.colddirect.co.uk/ is accessible. Resubmitted sitemap.xml through the UI; Google confirmed successful submission. Table still shows old 362 discovered URLs/last read 2026-10-06; do not treat this as failure of the deployed 112-URL map.
Existing local service-account credential verified using webmasters.readonly API calls; property permission siteOwner. No new credential/access grant, no secrets logged. URL Inspection: Services unknown to Google; fridge/freezer/cold-room London slash URLs PASS, Submitted and indexed. Requested Services indexing through Search Console; Google completed its live check and confirmed Indexing requested/priority crawl queue. Request accepted does not mean indexed; do not repeatedly resubmit it.
Google processes submitted sitemaps periodically. No new recurring automation created in this session. API read/report access works. Existing tools/request_indexing.py and agent/scripts/bulk_request_indexing.py use Indexing API for ordinary repair URLs; do not execute them for these pages. Official API eligibility is JobPosting or qualifying BroadcastEvent in VideoObject, not service pages. Next integration task is to replace unsupported notification calls with sitemap submission and URL Inspection reporting, preserving any existing scheduler after inventory review.
Evidence: local gsc-connection-result.json, gsc-sitemap-submitted.jpg, gsc-services-indexing-requested.jpg and gsc-report-fa.md. Post-release memory retained on ai/seo-canonical-sitemap; no documentation-only main deployment.

## 2026-10-07 — Daily Search Console monitoring active
Existing GSC service account reused with webmasters.readonly. No new access/key or unsupported Indexing API call. Codex automation colddirect-google-indexing-check is ACTIVE, daily at 09:00 Europe/London, in the existing chat. It executes the local C:\Users\khora\Documents\Codex\2026-10-07\c\gsc-monitor.py and compares completed snapshots in reports/gsc-monitor. Reports meaningful index/sitemap/API changes in Farsi; stays quiet on unchanged state. Google already accepted sitemap submission and Services indexing request; do not repeatedly submit it.
First full manual monitor run passed on 2026-10-07: 112 sitemap URLs, PASS=57, NEUTRAL=55. This is a first baseline, not newly gained rankings/indexation. First scheduled run is unverified. Local machine/app and required permissions/network must be available for future runs.
Alert checks pass for unchanged state, newly indexed page, loss of indexing and first baseline. An initial sequential run was stopped after 25 inspected URLs due to latency; no partial baseline was saved. Final implementation uses four independent HTTP clients with 30-second timeouts, bounded retries and writes only after all inspections succeed. Routine last-crawl timestamp changes do not trigger alerts. No production edits/deployment performed. Preserve existing Hermes/GitHub scheduled jobs; inventory found no existing Codex automation directory.
Next P0 website work remains the blog repair-cost redirect loop and brands canonical 404; monitoring is not their repair. Existing bulk Indexing API scripts are not invoked and still require separate correction/inventory before use.

## 2026-10-07 — Coordinated technical audit and first team repair
User authorized teamwork and automatic continuation. Head agent coordinated read-only workflow inventory, implementation and independent routing review. Existing GitHub writers: sitemap/robots02:00UTC, dailySEO05:00UTC, protected-page restore05:45UTC, root deploy on main/master push. Hermes evening schedules are documented, not fresh scheduler proof. Do not add a competing production writer.
Daily existing heartbeat colddirect-google-indexing-check updated ACTIVE at09:00London, name ColdDirect website SEO and engineering. It runs local website-health.py and gsc-monitor.py independently, reports meaningful changes/errors in Farsi, and can research/prepare isolated tested P0/P1 PRs with independent specialist review. It does not publish/merge unattended and must respect access/approval boundaries. First scheduled run remains unverified.
Public technical audit:112sitemap URLs,120unique requested paths;14issue records:three aliases of one cost redirect loop, brands404, nine bare/slash canonical inconsistencies, news missingH1. Eight fixturetests pass. Known Services/index.html canonical alias explicitly handled. Initial Accept header omitted the server XMLtype and was fixed to */*; no incomplete snapshot saved. Earlier falseServices canonical issue was audit correction, not website improvement. Snapshot currently at workspace reports/website-health/latest.json. PHP/operational routes excluded; reviewed publicASP canonicals only. Fourworkers30sec/2MB/samehost/8redirecthop bounds; transport/prerequisite failures preserve prior complete baseline.
Prepared PR18 https://github.com/ali221345/colddirect-website/pull/18 commit32a016383e7807ec6f581d5c2208143c296cc8de: exact cost article HTML pass-through, bare301slash, slash internalHTML; remove conflicting later external redirect in both existingconfigs.

This is not actualApache/IIS proof. Production verification GET/HEAD/queries/pageidentity/canonical/JSONLD/HTTPS/core/directoryblogs pending.
Automatic approval review rejected PR18 merge because it triggers Plesk/GitHub productiondeployment and exactapproval is missing. No retry, bypass, deployment or livefix performed. Requires specific userapproval before productionmerge; unaffectedmonitoringwork completed. Brands404 remains next separateP0. No ranking/indexationuplift claimed.
