# Daily index monitoring activation

## 2026-10-07 — Daily Search Console monitoring active
Existing GSC service account reused with webmasters.readonly. No new access/key or unsupported Indexing API call. Codex automation colddirect-google-indexing-check is ACTIVE, daily at 09:00 Europe/London, in the existing chat. It executes the local C:\Users\khora\Documents\Codex\2026-10-07\c\gsc-monitor.py and compares completed snapshots in reports/gsc-monitor. Reports meaningful index/sitemap/API changes in Farsi; stays quiet on unchanged state. Google already accepted sitemap submission and Services indexing request; do not repeatedly submit it.
First full manual monitor run passed on 2026-10-07: 112 sitemap URLs, PASS=57, NEUTRAL=55. This is a first baseline, not newly gained rankings/indexation. First scheduled run is unverified. Local machine/app and required permissions/network must be available for future runs.
Alert checks pass for unchanged state, newly indexed page, loss of indexing and first baseline. An initial sequential run was stopped after 25 inspected URLs due to latency; no partial baseline was saved. Final implementation uses four independent HTTP clients with 30-second timeouts, bounded retries and writes only after all inspections succeed. Routine last-crawl timestamp changes do not trigger alerts. No production edits/deployment performed. Preserve existing Hermes/GitHub scheduled jobs; inventory found no existing Codex automation directory.
Next P0 website work remains the blog repair-cost redirect loop and brands canonical 404; monitoring is not their repair. Existing bulk Indexing API scripts are not invoked and still require separate correction/inventory before use.

Manual results: local reports/gsc-monitor/latest.json. This monitors only current sitemap URLs, not every historically discovered property URL. Services still needs future inspection to establish indexing; an accepted priority crawl request is not proof. Read-only source scripts retained under tools; active automation uses the tested workspace copies.
