# Sitemap review — 2026-10-07

## 2026-10-07 — Sitemap inventory correction
PR #14 was explicitly approved, merged as 9453f995 and successfully deployed; 112 live robot policy checks and ten route checks passed. This supersedes earlier pending approval notes.

Fresh live sitemap: 362 entries, all unique: 226 redirects, 132 HTTP 500, two HTTP 404, two HTTP 200; those two declare other canonicals. The existing generator walked mirrors/internal repository paths and advertised raw .html/index.html aliases. Replaced it with public canonical discovery, robots/noindex filtering, live redirect/canonical resolution, deduplication and fail-before-write on transport/429/5xx. Both sitemap copies are identical. Daily workflow now stages the root sitemap it actually generates. Unverified lastmod dates omitted rather than marking every page freshly changed each run.

Prepared sitemap: 112 unique URLs, all freshly checked HTTP 200 with no noindex. Four focused regression tests pass. This is discovery-list cleanup, no page deletion or route/content change. No search ranking/indexation gain claimed; production release is pending. Some served pages declare a bare canonical that redirects to their slash URL; normalized served URLs are listed, while metadata consistency remains a separate task.

Next P0 routing investigations: /blog/commercial-fridge-repair-cost-london/ and its .html alias redirect to each other; /refrigeration-brands-repair-london/ returns 404. Both are excluded from this sitemap, not deleted. Recheck current policy before fixing routes. Also retain the current public ASP canonicals for chiller/ice-machine pages pending a separate canonical review.
